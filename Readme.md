<h1>Customizable Flash Cards</h1>

Flash Card Builder using Java.

I'm currently preparing for my GRE so I thought of building a customizable flash card for storing words that I learnt and then memorizing with Flash Card Feature. ;) <br><br>

Note: I'm still building this stuff. I wrote this in less than an hour as I reused most of the codes from my previous projects. I'll update you after Flash Card Feature is complete.<br>
'til then
